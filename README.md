# Batch Effect Assessment using Ranking

BatchRank is a method for assessing batch effects in (biomedical) data. It is based on the idea that batch effects can be
detected by conducting a Classifier-2-Sample-Test (C2ST). BatchRank runs a C2ST for each of the provided target variables and ranks the
results.
